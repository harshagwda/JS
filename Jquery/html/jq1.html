<h1>Using Toggle()</h1>

<p>	
	jQuery is a cross-platform JavaScript library designed to simplify the client-side scripting of HTML.[3] It is free, open-source software using the permissive MIT License.[2] Web analysis indicates that it is the most widely deployed JavaScript library by a large margin.
	</p>
<p>
	jQuery's syntax is designed to make it easier to navigate a document, select DOM elements, create animations, handle events, and develop Ajax applications. jQuery also provides capabilities for developers to create plug-ins on top of the JavaScript library. This enables developers to create abstractions for low-level interaction and animation, advanced effects and high-level, themeable widgets. The modular approach to the jQuery library allows the creation of powerful dynamic web pages and Web applications.
